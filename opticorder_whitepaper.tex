% Introduction
\section{Introduction: The Opticorder Vision}

\subsection{The Challenge of Access}
Optical frequency combs represent one of the most transformative technologies in modern photonics, enabling applications from precision metrology to quantum computing. However, access to this technology has been limited to well-funded laboratories with access to million-dollar systems requiring specialized expertise and extensive infrastructure. This exclusivity has stifled innovation and prevented the broader scientific and engineering community from exploring the vast potential of frequency comb technology.

The current market for optical frequency combs is dominated by expensive, bulky systems that require dedicated laboratory space, specialized training, and ongoing maintenance by expert technicians. This creates a significant barrier to entry for researchers, startups, and educational institutions that could benefit from this revolutionary technology.

\subsection{The Opticorder Solution}
Opticorder addresses this challenge through a revolutionary integrated photonics approach that combines the best of multiple material platforms in a modular, open source architecture. By integrating frequency comb generation directly onto photonic integrated circuits (PICs), Opticorder eliminates the need for complex external stabilization systems while achieving performance metrics that rival traditional laboratory setups.

The core innovation lies in the hybrid TFLN + SiN PIC platform, which combines the strong electro-optic effects of TFLN with the ultra-low loss and thermal stability of SiN. This hybrid approach enables the creation of frequency combs with unprecedented performance in portable form factors, opening new possibilities for field-deployable applications.

\subsection{Democratizing Photonics}
The core mission of Opticorder is to democratize access to optical frequency comb technology. Through open source collaboration, we aim to create a platform that not only provides access to cutting-edge technology but also enables the community to contribute to its evolution. This collaborative approach ensures that Opticorder remains at the forefront of innovation while building a sustainable ecosystem of contributors and users.

By making the hardware designs, software interfaces, and documentation openly available, Opticorder creates a foundation for innovation that extends far beyond our initial vision. The community-driven development model ensures that the platform evolves to meet the diverse needs of researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts worldwide.

\subsection{Market Disruption Potential}
Opticorder has the potential to disrupt the \$1M+ frequency comb market by delivering comparable performance at a fraction of the cost and size. The integrated approach reduces manufacturing costs through economies of scale in PIC fabrication, while the modular cassette architecture enables rapid customization for specific applications without requiring complete system redesign.

This disruption extends beyond traditional frequency comb applications, opening new markets in autonomous vehicles, portable medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and consumer electronics. By making frequency comb technology accessible to a broader range of users, Opticorder creates opportunities for innovation that were previously impossible due to cost and complexity barriers.

% Technology Overview
\section{Technology Overview: The Integrated Photonics Revolution}

\subsection{Why Integrated Photonics?}
Traditional optical frequency comb systems rely on bulk optics, complex alignment procedures, and extensive external stabilization hardware. This approach, while effective, results in systems that are bulky, expensive, and sensitive to environmental perturbations. Integrated photonics offers a fundamentally different approach by consolidating multiple optical functions onto a single chip, dramatically reducing size, weight, and power consumption while improving stability and reliability.

\subsection{The TFLN Advantage}
Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) represents a breakthrough in integrated photonics, combining the strong electro-optic (Pockels) effect of bulk lithium niobate with the high-confinement, low-loss waveguides of a thin-film platform. This unique combination enables the creation of high-performance modulators, filters, and nonlinear optical devices on a single chip, making TFLN ideal for integrated frequency comb generation and control.

\subsection{The SiN Alternative}
Silicon nitride (SiN) provides a complementary platform with exceptional optical properties for frequency comb generation. While lacking the strong electro-optic effect of TFLN, SiN offers ultra-low propagation losses and excellent thermal stability, making it ideal for applications requiring long-term stability and high coherence. The integration of SiN soliton microcombs with optical phased arrays (OPAs) opens new possibilities for applications like coherent LiDAR.
